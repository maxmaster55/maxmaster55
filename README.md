# 💻 Hi there! 👋

I'm Maxmaster55, an engineering student and software engineer with a ❤️ for coding and making fun projects.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including:

- Kotlin (expert)
- Python 🐍
- JavaScript 🕸
- React
- C
- Rust 🦀 (currently learning)

I'm also a big fan of Jetpack Compose and have experience building beautiful and responsive user interfaces for Android applications 📱. In addition, I have experience with Linux and am interested in embedded systems.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm a strong collaborator and thrive in team environments 🤝. I believe that communication and teamwork are crucial to the success of any project 🚀.
